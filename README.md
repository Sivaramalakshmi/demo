Once there was a young boy named Arjun who lived in a small village.He dreamed of becoming a skilled archer like the legendary warriors he admired.Every day after school he would practice with a simple bow and arrow he had crafted himself,aiming at a tree in the backyard.Despite his hard work,he struggled to hit the target consistently,and people in the village often laughed at him,saying he would never succeed.Arjun was discouraged but never gave up.
The villagers were stunned  by his achievement.Dronacharya smiled ,proud of his student's perseverance.Arjun's journey was a reminder to everyone  that success isn't about talent alone is about relentless effort  patience and refusal ,and the refusal  to quit when faced with challenges.
